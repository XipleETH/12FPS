# 12FPS

A weekly, collaborative, frame‑by‑frame animation game on Reddit.  
One shared canvas. One artist at a time. A story that grows frame by frame.

## What Happens Here?

We (the community) build a looping animation at **12 frames per second** during the week.  
Every saved frame becomes part of the week’s “film”. On Sunday just after midnight (00:01) the week is archived and a fresh canvas begins.

## How to Play (Turn System)

1. **Watch first.** Someone may already be drawing. You’ll see the current frame and onion skin (ghost of the previous one).  
2. **Claim a turn** when the button is available. You now have *up to 2 hours* (finish sooner if you want).  
3. **Choose your color** (from the 6 agreed palette) and a brush (from the 4 agreed set).  
4. **Draw** your frame. Use:
   - Brush (draw)
   - Eraser
   - Fill (bucket)
   - Onion skin (helps align motion)
   - Undo / Clear (local while on your turn)
5. **Save / Finalize** when happy. Your frame locks into the sequence.  
6. **Release the turn** so the next artist can continue the motion.

Only one person can paint at any moment. Patience keeps the flow smooth.

## Weekly Rhythm

- **Mon–Sat:** Add frames, evolve the loop, smooth transitions.  
- **All week:** In the chat / comments we discuss: story beats, palette ideas, brush kit ideas, upcoming theme.  
- **Voting:** We propose & vote on:
  - Next week’s **theme**
  - New **6‑color palette**
  - New **4‑brush kit**
- **Sunday 00:01:** Week locks → video archived → new blank timeline begins.

## Why Only 6 Colors & 4 Brushes?

Limits = Style cohesion. Everyone’s frames feel like part of the same world.  
It also speeds decisions—more drawing, less fiddling.

---

## Community & Moderation

- If a frame gets enough **negative votes**, it’s removed from the live loop and sent to moderation review (it might be restored).  
- Previous weeks’ animations remain viewable (an evolving archive).  
- Please keep motion consistent: help bridges between poses, smooth arcs, readable action.

## Simple Etiquette

| Do | Avoid |
| --- | --- |
| Build on prior motion | Random drastic resets |
| Leave clear poses | Clutter / unreadable strokes |
| Finish early if done | Holding turn doing nothing |
| Talk in chat for ideas | Silent abrupt tone shifts |

---

## Quick Start (TL;DR)

Open panel → Wait → Claim turn → Pick color + brush → Draw with onion skin → Save → Release → Cheer the next artist.

---

## Light Tech Note (For the Curious)

Runs on **Devvit (Reddit)** with **Redis** to store frames & palettes. Frontend: **React + Canvas**. That’s it—kept lean so play stays fast.

Let’s make years of tiny loops together. 🎬
